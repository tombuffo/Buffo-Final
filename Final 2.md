# Early Life

## Web Games
<p>When I was younger I loved to play games on the computer. Me and my friends would play simple browser based games all the time. we would play on websites like Miniclip and Addicting Games.</p>

## Console
<p> As me and my friends got older we got into more sonsole games. We could all be playing together, but we could alo be at different locations.<p/>

### Xbox 360
<p> We would play lots of xbox, because it was the first console that launched for our generation. We all loved playing together.
