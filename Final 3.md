# Coding
## Starting
<p> I started my coding experience with a class in high school and was very interuiged with the subject so I decided to explore it more. I started as a business major, but I decided to switch because I feel like IT suites my interest more than any feil of business. These are my first classes as an IT student at *The University of Missouri*. </p>
